# PolynomialCalculator
Input-Output by GUI
Can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, derivation and integration.
Input format is :
>monome monome monome...

where monome is:
> (sign)(coefficient)(variable)(exponent)

sign = +/-/nothing if first monome

coefficient = number/nothing as an alternative to 1

variable = any letter/ nothing if exponent is 0

exponent = number/nothing

It will dynamically interpret the input as a valid polyinomial, (adds the monomes with the same exponent, puts everything in order). 
In short, it works with all the possible edge cases, for the input.
